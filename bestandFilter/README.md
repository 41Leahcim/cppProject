This is a simple file filter for Linux. 
It removes duplicate files in one directory without removing directories. 
You could use it simply by starting the application. 
The program will ask you to enter the path to a directory and removes the files
as soon as you press enter. 
This way, it's easy to use for everyone using Linux.
I might add support for Command Line Arguments in the future to make it quicker
to use.
